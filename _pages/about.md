My name is Luis Aue and I am working on the project "Social Medicine" of Prof. Dora Vargha at Humboldt University, Berlin. My research focuses on the history of global or international health expertise. I am interested in a combination of scholarship from history, political science, and science and technology studies (STS). A recent article utilized STS concepts to analyze the history of quantification in international health politics. I explored how a shift to digital quantification practices reshaped the endeavor of international or global health.

I defended my doctoral thesis in political science in March 2022 at Free University
Berlin. The thesis forms the basis for my current book project on the global technological history of diarrheal diseases. In the book project, I analyze how experts designed specific interventions for the global North and the global South against diarrheal diseases. These “policies of inequity” contributed to globally diverging mortality from diarrheal diseases since the late 19th century.
