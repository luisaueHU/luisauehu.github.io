My name is Luis Aue and I am a postdoc at Humboldt University Berlin, in the ERC project "Socialist Medicine. An Alternative Global Health History". My research focuses on the history of global and international health expertise and combines scholarship from history, political science, and science and technology studies (STS). 

I defended my doctoral thesis in political science in March 2022 at Free University Berlin. The thesis forms the basis for my current book project on the global technological history of diarrheal diseases. In the book project, I analyze how experts designed specific interventions for the global North and the global South against diarrheal diseases. These “policies of inequity” contributed to globally diverging mortality from diarrheal diseases since the late 19th century.
