My name is Luis Aue and I am a postdoc at Humboldt University Berlin, in the ERC project "Socialist Medicine. An Alternative Global Health History". My research focuses on the history of global and international health expertise and combines scholarship from history, political science, and science and technology studies (STS). 

I defended my doctoral thesis in political science in March 2022 at Free University Berlin. The thesis forms the basis for my current book project on the global technological history of diarrheal diseases. I analyze how experts designed interventions against diarrheal diseases since the late 19th century. I explore how "domination in the laboratory" contributed to different technological designs for the global South and North.
